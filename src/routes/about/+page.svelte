			I love the culture and invigorating feeling of a steamy sauna, but moving around kept me from
			having my own. In 2020, I had the notion to build a compact and mobile sauna. After some hard
			work and generous donations from the community, Redd Sauna became a reality! I love being able
			to share the experience with my friends, old and new.

			Lil Red is a rustic 4' x 8' x 6' insulated room built onto a simple trailer frame. The
			interior siding and custom benches are locally milled from salvaged cedar. A small propane
			stove acts as the heater with a kettle for humidity. It gets hot, hot, hot!
